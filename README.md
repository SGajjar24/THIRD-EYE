# THIRD EYE 👁️

A comprehensive security and content auditing system designed to reveal unseen vulnerabilities and detect synthetic content origin with high precision.

## Project Overview

THIRD EYE provides automated security risk assessments and deep-dive analysis into content authenticity. By auditing target URLs, the system identifies critical vulnerabilities and evaluates the probability of human vs. synthetic (AI) content generation.
